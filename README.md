# Real Estate NOW! (3.1.18)

 ![Real Estate NOW! image] (https://mostwantedrealestatesites.com/images/MWR_3D_Box-right.png "The Real Estate NOW!")

Simple yet beautiful.  Our Real Estate component is multi-functional and will work with RETS or as a stand-alone.  The user-friendly interface allows for multi-choice features, multiple image galleries, drag and drop image uploads, open houses, featured listings, a watchlist for favorites, multiple categories, agencies, and so much more.  And of course itâ€™s designed for Joomla! only and is responsive.  Choose from Bing or Google maps.  The front-end management makes it easy for agents to add and update their profiles and their listings easily and efficiently.

The best way to see all your options is to install this component on you Joomla website and test all features yourself.
